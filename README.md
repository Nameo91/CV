## About Me 👩‍💻

I'm a self-driven and motivated Full Stack Junior Developer who recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have learned the fundamentals of software development by building diverting projects.

After moving to the UK, I looked over my career path and wanted a new challenge which excites me. My engineering background led me to software development. I'm passionate about learning something new and industries that are constantly progressing. 

I am looking forward to working in a company where I can strengthen my analytical mind and the confidence to solve real-life problems.
