## About Me üë©‚Äçüíª
I'm a self-driven and motivated Full Stack Junior Developer who recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have learned the fundamentals of software development by building various projects([Here are my projects](https://github.com/Nameo91?tab=repositories)) and I'm on my journey to become a continuously progressing software developer who writes good clean code.

After moving to the UK, I looked over my career path and wanted a new challenge which excites me. I'm passionate about learning something new and further developing myself and processes in the workplace. I'm attracted to the fact that there is no language barrier in coding, regardless of nationality, and coding is used everywhere in modern day life. It motivates me for a career change in an innovative and disruptive tech industry. My engineering background has also led me to software development. As a software developer providing simpler solutions to everyday people's problems, and being as creative as I can in doing so, intrigues me to start as a software developer. I would love to explore my curiosity in technology that is continually developing.
 
I'm looking forward to working in a company where I can strengthen my analytical mind and be equipped with knowledge to improve our everyday lives. I also hope to contribute to various projects, working as a team with my can-do attitude.

## Skills üí™

#### Excellent learner
- During the last group project at Makers, I built a full-stack web application with new tech stacks Angular, NestJS and Typescript in two weeks. I could have used already learnt stacks but I chose to further explore technical challenges to be placed outside my comfort zone.
- I was offered a full time position at the pharmacy where I worked as an intern. When COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out, I took a training course on vaccine draw and after completing short period of practice, I was preparing vaccines for administration.

#### Analytical thinker
- During the time at the headwear store, I increased sales growth by 200% and was placed in the top 5 over 130 stores for sales volume. I produced and analysed customer data report by gender, age and products on daily basis to help my stores sales volume which wasn't requested by the head office. As a result, the head office referenced my daily report to be reflected in the next season's product design. 

#### Attention to Details
- It is crucial for a pharmacy technician to have strong attention to details when dispensing prescriptions. Any minor changes in the dispensing process can seriously affect the care of the patient. During the time at Unichem, I improved accuracy in dispensing by 98%.

#### Good communicator and team player
- During the course at Makers, I often checked in with my team/pair partners to see how they were progressing and when people asked for help, I didn't hesitate to walk them through blockers.
- When operating the headwear store, I provided an excellent customer service to satisfy their needs and resolve any complaints. I was able to reduce the number of complaints from 15 queries a month to less than 5.
