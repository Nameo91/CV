## About Me üë©‚Äçüíª
I'm a self-driven and motivated Full Stack Junior Developer who recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have learned the fundamentals of software development by building various projects([Here are my projects](https://github.com/Nameo91?tab=repositories)) and I'm on my journey to become a continuously progressing software developer who writes good clean code.

After moving to the UK, I looked over my career path and wanted a new challenge which excites me. I'm passionate about learning something new and further developing myself and processes in the workplace. I'm attracted to the fact that there is no language barrier in coding, regardless of nationality, and coding is used everywhere in modern day life. It motivates me for a career change in an innovative and disruptive tech industry. My engineering background has also led me to software development. As a software developer providing simpler solutions to everyday people's problems, and being as creative as I can in doing so, intrigues me to start as a software developer. I would love to explore my curiosity in technology that is continually developing.
 
I'm looking forward to working in a company where I can strengthen my analytical mind and be equipped with knowledge to improve our everyday lives. I also hope to contribute to various projects, working as a team with my can-do attitude.

## Skills üí™

#### Excellent learner
- During the last group project at Makers, I built a full stack web application, **[Merry Crypto](https://github.com/Nameo91/merrycrypto-deploy)**, with new tech stacks Angular, NestJS and Typescript in only two weeks. I could have used already learnt stacks, but I chose to further explore technical challenges to be placed outside my comfort zone. Due to being able to pick up things quickly, I was, therefore, able to take up multiple features, such as **Login**, **Logout**, **Register**, **Watchlist**, related **News**, and recent **Twitter mentions** for each cryptocurrency from different APIs. I also built a lot of confidence in using the tech stacks I have not experienced.
- I do not hesitate to take on new challenges. I created a Twitter clone, **[Chitter](https://github.com/Nameo91/chitter-challenge)** in Ruby in 2 days. I utilised **ActiveRecord ORM** as the database interface to accept the further technical challenge.
- I was offered a full time position at the pharmacy where I worked as an intern. When COVID-19 vaccine was rolled out, I took a training course on vaccine draw and after completing short period of practice, I was preparing vaccines for administration.

#### Analytical thinker
- During the time at the headwear store, I increased sales growth by 200% and was placed in the top 5 over 130 stores for sales volume. I produced and analysed customer data report by gender, age and products on daily basis to help my stores sales volume which wasn't requested by the head office. As a result, the head office referenced my daily report to be reflected in the next season's product design. 
- A time when it was beneficial at Makers was implementing the TDD process to improve code quality and detect bugs quickly to resolve them. I was able to break down complex problems into smaller and more manageable components, identifying potential failure points.

#### Attention to Details
- It is crucial for a pharmacy technician to have strong attention to details when dispensing prescriptions. Any minor changes in the dispensing process can seriously affect the care of the patient. During the time at Unichem, I improved accuracy in dispensing by 98%. 
- This skill is key for coding to ensure that code is written accurately and free of errors. In software development, small details can result in unexpectable consequences. During the second group project at Makers, it allowed me to solve a problem with displaying profile images next to the comments because I was able to identify incorrect queries for the database quickly. 

#### Good communicator and team player
- During the course at Makers, I often checked in with my team/pair partners to see how they were progressing and when people asked for help and I did not hesitate to walk them through blockers. 
- When operating the headwear store, I provided an excellent customer service to satisfy their needs and resolve any complaints. I was able to reduce the number of complaints from 15 queries a month to less than 5.
