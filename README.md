## About Me üë©‚Äçüíª
I'm a self-driven and motivated Full Stack Junior Developer who recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have learned the fundamentals of software development by building various projects([Here are my projects](https://github.com/Nameo91?tab=repositories)) and I'm on my journey to become a continuously progressing software developer who writes good clean code.

After moving to the UK, I looked over my career path and wanted a new challenge which excites me. I'm passionate about learning something new. I'm attracted to the fact that there is no language barrier in coding, regardless of nationality, and coding is used everywhere in modern day life. My engineering background has led me to software development and I would love to explore my curiosity in technology that is continually progressing.
 
I'm looking forward to working in a company where I can strengthen my analytical mind and be equipped with knowledge to solve real-life problems. I also hope to contribute to various projects, working as a team with my can-do attitude.
